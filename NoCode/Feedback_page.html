<div style="text-align:left">
Before 11:59pm tonight, you need to describe for your negotiating partner your impressions of the negotiation as it unfolded. Think about instances that framed your understanding and emotions about the situation and share them in a constructive way. Professor Atwell will personally review what you submit to make sure it is suitable for sharing.
<br><br>
<p>To compose and submit your impressions, follow <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses\{{ feedback_url }}">this link to Canvas</a> (new tab)</p>
