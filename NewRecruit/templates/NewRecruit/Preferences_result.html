    You want the salary to be <strong>{{ player.salary }}</strong> and the bonus <strong>{{ player.bonus }}</strong> per year.
    The job would be in <strong>{{ player.job_assignment }}</strong> in <strong>{{ player.location }}</strong> starting <strong>{{ player.starting_date }}</strong>.<br><br>

    There would be <strong>{{ player.vacation_time }} days </strong>of vacation, enrollment in insurance <strong> {{ player.insurance_coverage }}</strong> and <strong>{{ player.moving_expenses }}</strong> of moving expenses would be covered.<br><br>

     This results in <strong>{{ player.total_points }} points</strong> out of the maximum <strong>13,200</strong> possible.<br><br><br>
